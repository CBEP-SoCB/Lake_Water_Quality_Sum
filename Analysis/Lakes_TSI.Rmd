# Introduction

Maine often uses a "Trophic State Index" (TSI) to assess water quality in Maine
lakes. The index can be calculated multiple different ways, based on measurement
of Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, or total phosphorus.  Here, we explore the
indexes Maine uses, and examine recent TSI data to consider whether to include
data or graphics on TSI in State of the Bay.

Ultimately, we decide there is little value to adding a TSI metric to SoCB, as
the the most abundant TSI value is based on Secchi Depth, and is a relatively
simple  transform of the Secchi depth data we have already considered.

# What is the Trophic State Index?
The Lakes of Maine web Site provides a document that explains the Trophic State 
Index as follows:

[Explanation of Individual Lake Water Quality Reports.pdf](https://www.lakesofmaine.org/data/Explanation%20of%20Individual%20Lake%20Water%20Quality%20Report.pdf)

>TROPHIC STATE INDICES: The Trophic State Index (TSI) is a scale which ranks
lakes from 0 to 100+ with 0 supporting very little algae and 100+ being very
productive. TSI can be calculated from the Secchi disk, Chlaor total phosphorus
results. TSI for a year is only calculated when there are at least five months
of data. Lakes with TSI values greater than 60 may support blooms (less than 2m
SDT). Lakes with TSI values over 100 indicate extreme productivity and annual
algal blooms. TSI values can be used to compare lakes and track water quality
trends within a lake. Lakes with color over 30 SPU will only have a valid TSI if
the value is calculated from Chla. The range of TSI is from 5-136 with an
average of 45. EPI PHOS = Epilimnetic Phosphorus samples taken to determine the
TSI; C = core G = grab samples taken; SEC = TSI value calculated using the mean
Secchi disk (water color < 30 SPU to ensure valid TSI); CHL = TSI calculated
using the mean Chla.

A primary purpose of the TSI concept is to allow evaluation of trophic state of
a given lake based on available data, which varies lake to lake. Correlations
among indexes calculated based on different source data are in the 70% range or
so.  Some users average the different indexes to produce a sort of meta index,
but chlorophyll a is a relatively direct measure of phytoplankton biomass, while
both Secchi depth and Total Phosphorus are indirect measures. Accordingly, the
TSI based on Chlorophyll A is sometimes preferred.

Maine regulators are generally going to take a weight of evidence approach to
evaluating trophic state, so no hard and fast rule is likely to apply.

It is also worth noting that Maine recognizes multiple versions of the
phosphorus TSI, depending on how samples for Total Phosphorus was collected.
We see that here, and in Maine DEP's Lakes data (see below) but neither source
provides clarity on whether the same mathematical formulae are used to
calculating the indexes or not.

# Maine TSI Definitions
Multiple references indicate Maine developed its own TSI scales, so we can not
simply use any TSI index.  Unfortunately, published versions of the Maine 
indexes have ambiguities that took us some time to unravel.  We present definitions
here, and show how the definitions relate to Maine DEP's TSI data at the end of
this Notebook.

Details on the Maine TSI formulae are provided in Maine regulation, specifically
[06-096 CMR 581: Regulations Relating to Water Quality Evaluations](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-12/documents/mewqs-cmr-581.pdf)
lays out regulations for water quality evaluations, including formulas for TSIs.
Section 6(A) includes the following information:

>  Trophic state is the ability of a body of water to produce algae and other
   aquatic plants.  The trophic state of a body of water is a function of its
   nutrient content and may be estimated using the Maine Trophic State Index
   (TSI) as follows:  
   All Lakes:	  

*						$TSI = 70 \space log (\text{mean chlorophyll a} + 0.7)$  
>  Lakes with water color <30 SPU:  
*					  $TSI = 70 \space log (.33 \space \text{mean total phosphorus}+ 0.7)$  

Unfortunately, the formula for the Secchi-based TSI is so poorly typeset (it
breaks over a page) that  it can not be interpreted clearly, but it appears to
be the following (**THIS IS INCORRECT**):
 
* 				 [$TSI = 70 \space log(\frac{105 +  0.7}{(\text{mean Secchi Depth})})$]

The regulations are ambiguous regarding the base of the logarithms used to
calculate these formulae.  We eventually figured out that we could match
published data values if we used the log base 10.

We could not use the Secchi formula from this source to recreate TSI numbers
from the Maine Lakes data, so we kept hunting for additional documentation.                 

A second version of the formulae, somewhat better typeset, can be found in 
Appendix C of  the following source:

>Welch, Barbara, Judy Potvin and Mary Ellen Dennis.  1982.  The Voluntary Water
Quality Monitoting Program: 1982 Project Report. Maine Collection. 193. 
(https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/me_collection/193/) 

It includes identical Chl and TP formulae, but offers a slightly different 
formula for the TSI based on Secchi Depth: 

* 			[$TSI = 70 \space log(\frac{105}{(\text{mean Secchi Depth})^2} + 0.7)$]

We were able to duplicate values for published data using this formula (with
log bse 10) , so we consider it correct.

# Other Versions of TSI
Multiple references indicate Maine developed its own TSI scales, so we can not
simply use of other TSI indexes, but calculating them may be useful for
comparison purposes.

## NALMS document
The [North American Lake Management Society](https://www.nalms.org/secchidipin/monitoring-methods/trophic-state-equations/)
(NALMA) provides the following formula (citing Carlson 1977), which is typical:  

$$TSI(SD) = 10[6-\frac{ln(SD)}{ln(2)}]$$  

The $\frac{ln(SD)}{ln(2)}$ term equates to the log base 2 of the Secchi depth.
This value goes up by one for each doubling of Secchi depth, and has value
zero for SD = 1 meter (because $log(1) = 0$). The constant outside the square
bracket provides scaling, and the constant inside the brackets, an offset
defining the value of the index at SD == 1. TSI for an SD of 1 is 60.  TSI
for an SD of two is 50, and so on.

## Reviewing the Source
> Carlson, Robert E. 1977.  A trophic state index for lakes.  Limnology and
  Oceanography 22(2)361-369.
  
Carlson started with a simple model of light extinction, and came up with an 
index using Secchi Depth as the basic observation.  He then developed
related indexes for Chl and TP using regression relationships among
chlorophyll, total phosphorus, and Secchi depth. Unfortunately, that means
there is no unambiguous way to extrapolate from Carlson's TSI formulae to
Maine's formulae.  Maine's indexes could be -- perhaps even should be -- 
based on different regression relationships and specific Maine policy goals.

#TSI Functions in R
## Maine TSI Functions
We can embody these formulae in a small R functions.
```{r}
tsi_sd_maine <- function(sec) {
tsi <- 70 * log10((105/sec^2) + 0.7)
return(tsi)
}


tsi_chl_maine <- function(chl) {
tsi <-  70 * log10(chl + 0.7)
return(tsi)
}

tsi_tp_maine <- function(tp) {
tsi <-  70 * log10(0.33*tp + 0.7)
return(tsi)
}
```

## Carlson TSI Functions
Note, these use natural logarithmns.
```{r}
tsi_sd_carlson <- function(sec) {
tsi <- 60 - 14.41 * log(sec)
return(tsi)
}

tsi_chl_carlson <- function(chl) {
tsi <-  9.81 * log(chl) + 30.6
return(tsi)
}

tsi_tp_carlson <- function(tp) {
tsi <-  14.42 * log(tp) + 4.15
return(tsi)
}
```

# Taylor Pond Example
There appears to be some inconsistency in Maine over use of the Maine TSI
formulae. For example, the [Taylor Pond Association website](http://taylorpond.org/)
provides the Carlson version of the formulae (as rewritten in log-linear form) 
for calculating TSI based on Secchi depth and Total Phosphorus.

For 2020, Taylor Pond Association reports
$$TP_{\text{core}} = 11.0\\
  TP_{\text{bottom}} = 17.5 \\
  SD = 5.35 \\
  TSI_{\text{Secchi}} = 35.8 \\
  TSI_{\text{Core TP}} = 38.7
$$

So we can confirm that they used the Carlson Formula, not the Maine formula:

```{r}
cat(paste('Maine:  ',round(tsi_sd_maine(5.35),2),'\n'))
cat(paste('Carlson:', round(tsi_sd_carlson(5.35),2)))
```

# Load Maine Lakes Annual TSI Data
```{r}
fn <- 'Annual_Means.csv'
annual_data <- read_csv(file.path(sibling, fn))

tsi_data <- annual_data %>%
  select(MIDAS, Lake, Town, Station, Year,
         Mean_Sec, Mean_Chla, Tphos_Ec,
         contains('TSI')) %>%
  mutate(all_na = is.na(Tsi_Sec) & is.na(Tsi_Chl) & 
                  is.na(Tsi_Tpec) & is.na(Tsi_Tppg)) %>%
  filter (! all_na) %>%
  select(-all_na)
```
# TSI Data Availability
```{r}
tsi_data %>%
  select(Lake, contains('Tsi')) %>%
  group_by(Lake) %>%
  summarize(across(contains('Tsi'), function(x) sum(! is.na(x)))) %>%
  arrange(Tsi_Sec)
```
Tsi_Sec is the most abundant estimate of TSI. Chlorophyll-based and
phosphorus-based TSI values are somewhat less abundant, but still fairly
common. Only one lake, Woods Pond, lacks data on trophic index based on Secchi
depth, but has a substantial record of trophic index estimates based on another
parameter.

Several references discuss which TSI to use when several are available.  Since
the TSI is an estimate of phytoplankton biomass, several emphasize the
Chlorophyll A based version, as chlorophyll is a fairly direct estimator of
biomass.  However, there is a balance here between relying on the BEST
estimator, and relying on the estimator for which we have the most data.  
Unfortunately, there is nothing in the data we have available that suggests the
different TSI metrics are unbiased estimators of one another.  We take a closer
look.

# Correlations Among TSI Scores
We add a red 1:1 line to help visualize relationships. REgression lines would be
biased downwards due to error in measuring x axis values, so are less useful for
assessing bias here.
```{r}
lowerfun <- function(data,mapping){
  ggplot(data = data, mapping = mapping)+
    geom_point()+
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept =0, color = 'red', lty = 2)
}

plt <- tsi_data %>%
    select(contains('Tsi')) %>%
    ggpairs(lower = list(continuous = wrap(lowerfun)),
           progress = FALSE)
plt
```
So Tsi_Sec and Tsi_Chl are fairly well correlated, with a slope close to 1:1.
Tsi_Tpec appears to be almost, but not quite as well correlated with the other
indexes. Data is too sparse to assess the other phosphorus-based index.

# Preliminary Graphics
## TSI~Secchi~ Graphic
We need to create a reordered version of the Lake Names, and for some reason,
the usual `fct_reorder()` function was not behaving as expected, so we create 
a reordered factor by hand.
```{r}
theorder <- tsi_data %>%
  select(Lake, Tsi_Sec) %>%
  group_by(Lake) %>%
  summarize(med = median(Tsi_Sec, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(med) %>%
  pull(Lake)

tsi_data  <- tsi_data %>%
  mutate(lake_ordered = ordered(Lake, levels = theorder))

rm(theorder)
```

```{r}
ggplot(tsi_data, aes(x=lake_ordered, y = Tsi_Chl)) +
  geom_violin(scale='width', fill = cbep_colors()[6]) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'point', fun = median,
               pch = 19) +
    ylab('Trophic State Index') +
  xlab('') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  
  coord_flip()
```

## Grouped Graphic
We can show  several TSI variants on one graph, but it is slightly hard to read.
```{r}
tsi_long <- tsi_data %>%
  select(-Tsi_Tppg) %>%
  
pivot_longer(contains('TSI'), names_to = 'Parameter', values_to = 'TSI')
```

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 8}
tsi_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=lake_ordered, y = TSI)) +
  geom_violin(scale='width', fill = cbep_colors()[6]) +
  facet_wrap('Parameter', nrow = 1) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'point', fun = median,
             pch = 19) +
    ylab('Trophic State Index') +
  xlab('') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line()) +
  
  coord_flip()
```

## Comparison of Maine and Carson TSI Formulae
Here we compare results over reasonable ranges of Secchi Depth, chlorophyll, and
Total Phosphorus, and show that result are slightly different, but consistent.
The Maine formulae give slightly steeper increases in TSI as the values of the
drivers change.  The two formulae give similar values at: 
* $ SD \approx 7$
* $ Chl~a~ \approx 3.5$
* $ TP \approx 6$

##### Secchi Depth TSI
We reverse the X axis so this plot visually aligns with the other two, with
"better" conditions to the right.

```{r  fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(tibble(x = seq(1.5, 10, 0.25)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_sd_maine,  color = 'blue') +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_sd_carlson,  color = 'green') +
  xlab('Secchi Depth (reversed)') +
  ylab('TSI') +
  labs(subtitle = 'TSI Based on Secchi Depth\n(Green is Carlson, Blue is Maine)') +
  scale_x_reverse( breaks = (1:5)*2) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100))
```

#####  CHl TSI
The Maine formula looks implausible. Moderate chlorophyll levels are
mapped to very high TSI values, well above what you would get by applying
either of the other two values in Maine lakes.
```{r  fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(tibble(x = seq(1, 15, 0.25)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_chl_maine,  color = 'blue') +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_chl_carlson,  color = 'green') +
  xlab('Chlorophyll A (ppb)') +
  ylab('TSI') +
  labs(subtitle = 'TSI Based on Chlorophyll\n(Green is Carlson, Blue is Maine)') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = (1:5)*3) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100))
```


#####  TP TSI
This relationship also shows the Maine formula estimating high TP values, but
the results are roughly comparable to what one might get from the Secchi
version.
```{r  fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(tibble(x = seq(1, 50, 0.25)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_tp_maine,  color = 'blue') +
  stat_function(fun = tsi_tp_carlson,  color = 'green') +
  xlab('Total Phosphorus (ppb') +
  ylab('TSI') +
  labs(subtitle = 'TSI Based on Total Phosphorus\n(Green is Carlson, Blue is Maine)') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,50), breaks = (1:5)*10) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100))
```
