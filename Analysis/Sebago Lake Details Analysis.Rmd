# Introduction
Sebago lake is our region's largest lake, and one of the most important.  it is 
a crucial recreational resource for the region, and also provides high qUality
drinking water for tens of thousands.

Not coincidentally, Sebago Lake also has one of the longest and riches records of water quality monitoting of any lake in the region.

Here we leverage that rich data to look a bit more closely at how
water clarity varies in space and time.

# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(readxl)
#library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

library(mgcv)

library(CBEPgraphics)
load_cbep_fonts()
theme_set(theme_cbep())
```

# Load Data
## Folder References
```{r}
sisterfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sister <- file.path(parent,sisterfldnm)
```

## Read Parsed Lakes Data and Limit to Sebago Lake 
```{r}
fn <- 'Secchi.csv'
Secchi <- read_csv(file.path(sister, fn)) %>%
  filter(MIDAS == 5786) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%Y')))
```
We remove two values from the Sebago Lake record.
```{r}
Secchi <- Secchi %>%
  filter( ! (MIDAS == 5786 & Station == 50))
```

## Read PWD Sebago Lakes Secchi Depth Data
```{r}
fn <- 'Secchi_Sebago.csv'
Secchi_Sebago <- read_csv(file.path(sister, fn))
```

```{r}
secchi_sebago_data <- Secchi %>%
  select(-c(Secchi_On_Bottom:Cloud_Cover)) %>%
  bind_rows(Secchi_Sebago)
```

```{r}
rm(Secchi, Secchi_Sebago)
```

## Read Station - Region Association
```{r}
fn <- 'Sample Point Distances and Regions.xlsx'
regions <- read_excel(file.path(sister, fn), sheet = 'Sample_Locations') %>%
  select(Station, Region)
```

## Add Regions to Data
```{r}
secchi_sebago_data <- secchi_sebago_data %>%
  left_join(regions, by = 'Station') %>%
  filter(! is.na(Region)) %>%
  mutate(Region = factor(Region))
```

```{r}
rm(regions)
```

# Temporal Patterns
```{r}
ggplot(secchi_sebago_data, aes(Year, Secchi_Depth)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region)) +
  geom_smooth( se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Region) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

There are clear patterns there that we do not want to assume are chance, due to
the large number of samples involved, but trends are not consistent across
regions (or, presumably, across Stations).

Note that Big Bay North,  Big Bay West, and South Central have limited samples
from the last 10 years or so, While Jordan Bay has little data from before 1990.
We may want to limit data at some point to simplify analyses.

# Analysis Logic
We are interested in looking at smoothed temporal trends, so we are probably
looking at using a GAM model or a GAMM model if we want to explicitly model
stations as random factors.  hat feels unnecessary for a preliminary analysis.

```{r}
the_gam <- gam(Secchi_Depth ~ Region + s(Year, by = Region), 
               data = secchi_sebago_data)
summary(the_gam)
```

```{r}
plot(the_gam, shade = TRUE, pages = 1, scale = 0)
```
Some of those extreme values make no sense in this context, so something's not
working at the limits.


# Reduced Data for Simplicity
```{r}
reduced_data <- secchi_sebago_data %>%
  filter(Year > 1989, ! Region %in% c('Big Bay North',
                                      'Big Bay West',
                                      'South Central'))
```


```{r}
reduced_gam <- gam(Secchi_Depth ~ Region + 0 + s(Year, by = Region), 
               data = reduced_data)
summary(reduced_gam)
```

```{r}
plot(reduced_gam, se = TRUE, shade = TRUE, pages = 1)
```
Now THAT looks more informative.  Lake wide, there have been periods of better
or worse water clarity, especially around 1990 to 2002 or so.  Since 2006,
clarity has gradually improved.  It is actually pretty remarkable that results
are so consistent across the lake.

the GGPLOT default smoothers missom of thies detail, because they oversmooth.
```{r}
ggplot(reduced_data, aes(Year, Secchi_Depth)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region)) +
  geom_smooth( se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Region) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.25))
```

# Spatial Variation?
Without going to the extreme of using geospatial methods, the easiest way to get
a feel for variability associated with location is by looking at ANOVAs.
```{r}
the_lm <- lm(Secchi_Depth ~ factor(Station) + factor(Year), data = secchi_sebago_data)
anova(the_lm)
```
So, the mean square error of the residuals is small compared to station or Year
factors, but the model is unbalanced, so this needs to be interpreted with care.
If we reverse the order of fit, more of the variance is explained by Year, and
less by Station.

```{r}
the_lm <- lm(Secchi_Depth ~ factor(Year) + factor(Station),
             data = secchi_sebago_data)
anova(the_lm)
```
```{r}
the_lm <- lm(Secchi_Depth ~ factor(Year) + Region + factor(Station),
             data = secchi_sebago_data)
anova(the_lm)
```
